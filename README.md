### Hello!

👋 I'm **Nils**

✨ I build UI's and play around with animations

✍️ In my spare time, I build open source libraries and [write blog posts](https://www.haberkamp.dev/)

<br />
<br />

I work as a Design Engineer [@shopware](https://github.com/shopware), where I maintain the [Meteor Design System](https://www.github.com/shopware/meteor). When I'm not coding, I'm probably trying out a new hobby.
