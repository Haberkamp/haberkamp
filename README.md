### Hello!

üëã I'm **Nils**

‚ú® I build UI's and play around with animations

‚úçÔ∏è In my spare time, I build open source libraries and [write blog posts](https://www.haberkamp.dev/)

<br />
<br />

I work as a Design Engineer [@shopware](https://github.com/shopware), where I maintain the [Meteor Design System](https://www.github.com/shopware/meteor). When I'm not coding, I'm probably trying out a new hobby.

Project I've contributed to: [Astro](https://github.com/withastro/astro/pull/13383), [typescript-eslint](https://github.com/typescript-eslint/typescript-eslint/pull/7129), [eslint-plugin-playwright](https://github.com/playwright-community/eslint-plugin-playwright/pull/160/files) and [@vue/test-utils](https://github.com/vuejs/test-utils/pull/2265/files)
